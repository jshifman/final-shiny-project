What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
1) How has the skill level of 3-point shooting changed over time (increased/decreased/same)?
- We can answer this by specifically comparing the percentage of successful 3-pointer divided by total attempted 3-pointers over the years.  
2) Over the years, how the total amount of points made per game changed?
- We can answer this by comparing the total or average points made per game per season and compare across different seasons
3) How do the stats of past NBA stars (ex: Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan) compare to the stats of the NBA stars today (ex: Lebon James, Anthony Davis)
- We can answer this by deciding the most important statistics/factors that play a role in the success of a play and compare those factors to some of the biggest players across the generations.
